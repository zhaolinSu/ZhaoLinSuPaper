A concept of "cashier-free supermarket" is proposed in nowadays.
This is a work to use the Unity3D to simulate a complete supermarket.
 In our simulator scene,  we joined the item identification system.
It is including multi camera layout and weight sensor.
The item recognition is base on YOLOv3, and recognition processing by image which get form multi cameras.
From the simulator scene, it can be used in real supermarket.
This experiment can be used as a reference for the "cashier-free supermarket".
