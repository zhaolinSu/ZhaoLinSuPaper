So in recent years, many shopping malls have sought to transform and reduce labor costs with the same profits.
In recent year, there are many stores that require little or no manual labor, many stores have changed their business model..
They all use computer identification technology to reduce labor costs, and it has more advantages than traditional shopping malls.
